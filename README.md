# Week-3-Code-Challenge
#  Blog Post Manager

A simple, fully interactive blog post application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and powered by **JSON Server** for mock backend API functionality.

Users can:
- View a list of blog post titles
- See post details
- Add new posts
- Edit or delete existing posts

This project was developed as part of the **Phase 1 Code Challenge**.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Live Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) (or Live Server extension for VS Code)
- [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

##  Project Structure

```
blog-post-app/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
├── src/
│   └── index.js
└── db.json
```

---

##  Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or Create the Project Folder**:

   ```bash
   mkdir blog-post-app && cd blog-post-app
   ```

2. **Create Required Files**:

   - `index.html`
   - `src/index.js`
   - `css/styles.css`
   - `db.json`

3. **Install JSON Server**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server@0.17.4
   ```

4. **Start the JSON Server**:

   ```bash
   json-server db.json
   ```

   This will run your mock API at: `http://localhost:3001`

5. **Start the Frontend Server**:

   Use Live Server to open `index.html` in your browser:

   ```bash
   live-server

##  Features

###  Core Deliverables

- View all blog post titles in a list on page load
- Click a post title to view its details (title, content, author)
- Add new posts via a form (`#new-post-form`)
- Function `main()` starts the app on `DOMContentLoaded`

###  Advanced Deliverables

- Automatically display the **first post's details** on page load
- Edit a post with an "Edit" form (`#edit-post-form`)
- Delete a post with a "Delete" button
- All changes are **persisted to the backend API**

---

##  Technical Breakdown

- **JavaScript**: Fetch API, DOM manipulation, event listeners, form handling
- **HTML/CSS**: Semantic HTML, responsive layout, basic styling
- **JSON Server**: Mock RESTful API to simulate backend interactions
- **Structure**:
  - Modular, well-named functions (`displayPosts`, `handlePostClick`, etc.)
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Clean separation of concerns
